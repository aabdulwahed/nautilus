# Contributing

Nautilus consists of a de-centered collection of repositories containing mostly markdown files. Find a list of them at: http://52.59.198.28:8080/.

## Questions

If you have any questions, either:
1. Contact one of [the maintainers](https://github.com/diminator/nautilus/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) directly.
2. Create an issue in an active repository. See http://52.59.198.28:8080/ for which repositories are active.

## Overview

- Individual contributions should be made in your own fork of one (any) of the other forks
- `diminator/nautilus` is the OG repo, but it's not the de facto 'upstream' repository
- To make a contribution to another fork:
  - Create a new branch in your own repository, subject to `the naming convention` (TBD)
  - Commit the changes to your branch
  - Sync your branch to the master branch of the repository you want to merge into
  - Open a pull request in that repository
- Note: you can only loosely trust that contributions will be circulated, unless you make a pull request in every other fork

## Ways of Contributing

### Problems

- Current consensus holds that you evolve the project by:
  - Contributing 'problems'
  - Solving 'problems'

#### Creating a Problem

- Create a new branch called `problems/[name-of-your-problem]`
- Create a file in `docs/problems`
- Commit the file to your branch and merge it into master
