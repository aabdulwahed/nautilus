# Open Source Software Governance

## The Problem

At the point of writing, this project doesn't describe a process of how
contributors should or have to collaborate. This document's purpose it to
explore potential problems to be encountered when developing open source
software collaboratively.

### The Problem of Problems

Upfront, a potential problem may be that this document becomes to encompassing
for individual problems to be discussed properly. If this is the case, the
authors may split the document into sub-problems, assuming that this will lead
to documenting and addressing problems more easily.

### The Problem of Context

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance), Governance
is defined as:

> [The] processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market or
> network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization or
> territory and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an
> organized society.

In the case of open source software project, governance then means lending
process structures of interaction and decision-making for the purpose of
collective creation.

Applied to the context of this repository, governance then means process
structures for collaborators to interact and collectively make decisions to
create Ocean Protocol - a network for a decentralized data economy.
