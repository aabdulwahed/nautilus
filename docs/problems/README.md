## The Problem

Being successful at communication is hard. Not only are there now hundreds of
communication mediums to chose from, they all introduce their own concepts of
conveying context-specific information.

Think about the last conversation you had before reading this document. Was it
face-to-face?  On a phone without seeing the opposite? Through a instant
messenger? Or maybe, was it you writing a GitHub issue?

When having that f2f, did you look the other person in the eyes? What was their
facial impression while talking and listening? How were they dressed? How did
they react to statements and particular words? Where did they position
themselves in the room? What was the exact sequence of words they said? What
questions did they ask?

And in your last phone call, did you examine the opponents voice? Did one of
you have to repeat themselves because the call's connection dropped? What language(s)
did the two of you use? Did one of you use the phrase: "I'll send you a email
about that later"? In your opinion, what was the opponents mood before and
after your conversation. And, are you convinced to have gotten your point
across?

You might also ask yourself: Should I send this email? This text? Should I
sleep over it? What words am I using? May they offend someone? How do I write a
neutral GitHub issue; or do I even care about being neutral? What if I _need_
this particular feature for the project I'm working on? Does it fit the
roadmap? The vision, the bigger picture? Do _I_ care?

And more ironically, right now you may ask yourself: "Why is a stupid `.md`
file asking me all these hard questions?" and, "how can I file a pull request
to remove it?". Maybe most importantly: "_Who_ wrote this???".

Assuming the reader's convictions, the author(s) urges to read on.

Communication is a problem. Conveying information is a problem. Agreeing on
problems is a problem. And, since developing software relies on communicating
how to develop software, software development is a problem.

## The Assumed Solution

[Peter Hintjens' conviction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFVDNTXIC_Y) was
that unidentified assumptions and contexts are _a_ root cause of communication
failing. _Assuming_ they are, Peter outlines _a_ solution as following:

1. All issues describe problems
1. Problem descriptions do not suggest solutions. They don't contain or hide
   assumptions
1. Problems have relevancy
1. Problems can be challenged
1. Problems can be solved in many different ways. The best solutions will
   ultimately stand out
1. Assuming assumption-lacking problem identification leads to successful
   communication, identification of the right solutions that lead to successful
   software development lead to successful software.

Given this _assumed solution_, the author(s)'d like to invite you to take part
in an experiment.

### How?

Take a look at this document and its structure. Take a look at the folder and
its other documents. Check their structure, their syntactic and semantic
properties. Think about how _you_'d like to contribute. Does this document have
problems itself. Does the folder structure? If so, what are they? Write them
down. Submit them. Then think about how to fix them. Or, let others fix them
for you.
