# git and GitHub

## The Problem

`git` is a tool created by developers for developers. GitHub layers a better
but work-flow opinionated UI solution above `git`. Contributors may find  using
`git` or GitHub, or the way the project embraces a certain `git`/GitHub process
complicated, inefficient, etc.
