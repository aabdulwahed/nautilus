# Token Units

## The Problem

Ocean network introduces a transferable asset. Given its users are willing to
trade this asset against other assets like (crypto-) currencies etc., we'll
have to mutually agree on these assets' units, their names, symbols and their
relations to each other. Take Bitcoin as a specific example. The smallest
representable unit of exchange on-chain is called a "Satoshi" ("sat"). To
exchange an [SI base unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit) of
bitcoins to another account, most users would transfer 100,000,000 Satoshi -
commonly agreed to as a "BTC". Since Bitcoin's community is largely in
agreement over it's units, their names, symbols and relations, "transferring a
bitcoin" hardly ever leads to confusion or miscommunication.

This problem statement seeks to gather ideas and solutions of how Ocean
network's asset should be "united", what those units' names and symbols should
be and how they should stand in relation to each other.
